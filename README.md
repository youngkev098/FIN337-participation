# Welcome to my FIN 377 - Participation Repo! :smiley: 

**In this Repo are files to be sumbitted for FIN 377 Participation Grade**

This Repo is organized as follows:

- **codebook**: holds my personal cheatsheet 
- **homework**: is a folder for homework and after class practice files	
- **livecoding**: are the coding that is done in class
- **misc**: holds files that do not fall into the catergories in this repo 
- **.gitignore**: holds personal files that I use for studying 
- **README.md**: is the readMe file for this repo
- **navigating_github**: is a file that helps me to begin to navigate gitHub better.

*DISCLAMIER* I had some issues removing the .ipynb_checkpoints on Mac, but as you can see there is a .gitignore file.
