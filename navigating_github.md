### Jupyter Quickstart 
- **I have used Jupyter Before this class and understand how to navagiate Jupyter.**

#### How TO: 
- to open my participation repo in Jupyter I run: jupyter notebook app and search for my participation repo on my desktop.

### THE GOLDEN RULES


- PLAN BEFORE YOU CODE
    - A. "Pseudo code" is writing out the broad steps in plain language. I often (almost always for complicated tasks) do this on paper, then translate it to code as an outline (in the code's comments). 
    - Break the problem into chunks/smaller problems. 
- Automation 
    - A. Automate everything that can be automated, don't do point-and-click analysis!
    - B. Write a single script that executes all code from beginning to end
- Version control
    - A. Store code and data under version control. Revisit the GitHub workflow recipe as needed!
    - B. Before checking the directory back in, clear all outputs and temp files and then run the whole directory! (Check: Did it work right?) 
- Directories
    - A. Separate directories by function
    - B. Separate files into inputs and outputs
    - C. Make directories portable
- Keys / Units
    - A. Store cleaned data in tables with unique, non-missing "keys"
    - B. Keep data normalized as far into your code pipeline as you can
- Abstraction - fncs/classes
    - A. Abstract to eliminate redundancy
    - B. Abstract to improve clarity
    - C. Otherwise, don't abstract
    - D. Unit test your functions!
    - E. Don't use magic numbers, define once as variables and refer as needed
- Documentation
    - A. Is good... to a point
    - B. Don't write documentation you will not maintain
    - C. Code is better off when it is self-documenting
- Randoms 
    - NEVER DRAW RANDOM NUMBERS WITHOUT A SEED
